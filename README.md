# SH59_Keysystem
This FiveM resource allows players to manage their vehicle keys.

## Overview
#### Showcase Video
[SOON]

#### Features
- Transfer master-keys to other players
- Create new keys at the locksmith
- Exchanging vehicle lock at the locksmith (invalidates all keys of the vehicle)
- Transfer keys to other players
- Easy Configuration (config.lua)
- Discord Logging (Optional)
- Ecallbacks and events to implement in other scripts (e.g. carlock, garage, etc.)


#### Requirements
- ESX (should work with every version)
- mysql-async

#### Important Note
This script provides only the Key Management system.
- You have to code the function of the vehicle keys in your scripts (e.g. carlock, garage, etc.) by yourself using the callbacks and events.
- Here is a esx_carlock fork, which already works with sh59_keysystem: [esx_carlock](https://github.com/SteakHarpyie59/esx_carlock)
